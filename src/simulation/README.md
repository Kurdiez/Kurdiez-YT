# Simulations

## Running a simulation

Each simulation has a name that can be used in the CLI command to execute that simulation.
For example, we can run the `monthlyIncomeFunds.ts` simulation with

```bash
# run with default option values
$ yarn cmd monthlyIncomeFunds

# bring up help menu to see possible options
$ yarn cmd monthlyIncomeFunds -h

# run with different years option value
$ yarn cmd monthlyIncomeFunds -y 20
```
